<title>User Container</title>

</head>
<body>
<h1>User Container</h1>

<p>As mentioned, a user container in a vocabulary defines a set of user categories to be regulated. The user categories are further organized into hierarhical structures.</p>

<p>An example user container view is as follows (appears when clicking "User Container" under the id of the vocabulary in the navigational tree).</p>

<p><img src="../img/user_container.png" width="800" height="600"></p>

<p>In the upper part of the user container view, the policy writer can edit the basic information of the user container, including its ID, Short Description and Long Description. In the lower part of the view, there is a tree showing all user categories defined in the container. When some user category in the tree is selected, the information of the user category is shown in the right part correspondingly.</p>

<h2>User Category</h2>

<p>All user categories in a user container is shown in the user category tree. In the following, we will show how to manage user categories, add/edit/delete a user category respectively.</p>

<h3>Add a User Category</h3>

<p>To add a user category, one can right click the user category tree and a popup menu will show up as follows.</p>

<p><img src="../img/add_user_category.png" width="400" height="356"></p>

<p>Here the policy writer has two options to add a user category:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add: the new user category is added as the sibling (in the same level) of the selected user category.</li>
<li>Add Child: the new user category is added as the child of the selected user category.</li>
</ul>


<p>Note that in both cases, the id of the new user category should be unique, i.e., a user container cannot have two user categories with the same id (including the <a href="#inherit">inherited user categories</a>).</p>

<h3>Edit a User Category</h3>

<p>To edit a user category, one can simply click the target user category in the user category tree, and the information of the selected user category is shown in the right panel as follows.</p>

<p><img src="../img/edit_user_category.png" width="800" height="359"></p>

<p>In the right panel, the policy writer can change the ID, parent ID, Short Description and Long Description of the selected user category.
But remember, the ID must be unique, and the referenced parent user category cannot be a cycle.</p>

<h3>Delete a User Category</h3>

<p>To delete a user category, one can simplify click Delete on the popup menu. But note that there are two options to deal with the children user categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cascade: all children categories of the deleted user category will also be deleted.</li>
<li>Non-cascade: the children categories of the deleted user category remain, and their parents are set as the parent of the deleted user category.</li>
</ul>


<p>For example, suppose <em>manager</em> is deleted. In Cascade mode, <em>senior manager</em> is deleted as well. While in Non-cascade mode, <em>senior manager</em> is not deleted and its parent is set as <em>employee</em>.</p>

<h2><span id="inherit">Inherited User Category</span></h2>

<p>For a vocabulary, if the base vocabulary is set, then the user categories defined in the base vocabulary is also shown in the user category tree. An example is shown as follows.</p>

<p><img src="../img/inherited_user_category.png" width="800" height="600"></p>

<p>Here user category <em>user</em> is defined in the base vocabulary, and <em>emloyee</em> is set as a child of <em>user</em>.
Note that the user categories defined in the base vocabulary are read-only, i.e., they cannot be edited in current vocabulary.
To edit them, one should open the base vocabularly separately, edit then save it, and reload the current vocabulary.</p>

<p>Also remember that the user categories should be unique among the vocabulary and all the base vocabularies.
For example, one cannot define user category <em>user</em> in current vocabulary again since it has already been defiend in the base vocabulary.</p>
